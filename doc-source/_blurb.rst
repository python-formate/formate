``formate`` runs a series of user-selected hooks which reformat Python source files.
This can include :ref:`changing quote characters <dynamic_quotes>`,
:ref:`rewriting imports <collections-import-rewrite>`, and calling tools such as
`isort <https://pycqa.github.io/isort/>`__ and `yapf <https://github.com/google/yapf>`__.
